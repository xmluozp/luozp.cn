### `About My Personal Website`

This is a practice project of React CRA + Hooks + Heroku pipeline
<br />
The effect was modified from Kenji Saito's logo switching effect. I changed some vertices calculation and did some performance optimizing to fit my needs.
<br />
I didn't use Bootstrap 4. So that I can practice scss.

<br />
My current most familiar back-end is PHP with Codeigniter. I didn't link any back-end of this website right now. The next thing I am going to learn and upgrade is Node.js + SSR
